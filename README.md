# Blood Donation Prediction System

## Overview

This repository houses the code for a predictive system designed to estimate the probability of an individual making a blood donation. The system utilizes machine learning, specifically employing a Naive Bayes algorithm, and takes into account various features such as the individual's name, blood group, and city. The implementation includes a user-friendly interface that facilitates real-time predictions, enhancing accessibility and usability for potential users.

## Why ONEAPI
![219417310-711955c1-d763-4531-9a0f-88d021112950](https://github.com/mohamedbadus/Project_Intel/assets/116250693/f7e72986-ca26-43d1-b2ef-e15644810833)

The grand idea behind oneAPI is to enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware, hence developers would not have to use different languages, tools, and libraries when they code for CPUs and GPUs

## Model Comparison

We evaluated three machine learning models:

1. Naive Bayes (chosen, accuracy 0.75)

2. Logistic Regression (accuracy 0.74)

3. Random Forest (accuracy 0.71)

Based on these results, we chose Naive Bayes as it provided the highest accuracy.
